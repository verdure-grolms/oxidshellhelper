# Inspired by the blog post 
# http://www.marmalade.de/magazin/2014/11/oxid-datenbankdump-ohne-views/
# I wrote this script to simplify the process of dumping a mysql database
# without the views. 

# Depending on the directory you put this scipt in and the directory oxid
# resides in you need to adjust the location of the oxid configuration file.
